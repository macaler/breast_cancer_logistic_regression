# breast_cancer_logistic_regression
This is a little project that I did after an idle prompt at the end of Codecademy's Logistic Regression lesson. They recommended finding a data set for binary classification to practice building logistic regression models, and suggested the Scikit-Learn breast cancer data set in particular. I decided to give such a project a go.

This project was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the Scikit-Learn breast cancer data set, and utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and other Scikit-Learn packages in my analysis. So long as you have Jupyter Notebook and the named packages installed, the project should run on your machine.

The project itself has been included as MAC_bc_lr_project.ipynb.
